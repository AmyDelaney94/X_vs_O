Prevented Computer Player from chosing the box chosen in the previous turn. | <img src="assets/images/CPUoverwritebug.PNG"> | - This was achieved through the introduction of the function randomNumber(). <br> - I added an alert during the testing phase to notify me when the Computer was attempting to selected an unavilable box. <br> - I researched this issue on stack overflow and fixed the issue with logic. <br> - When this bug was fixed it gave rise to my unfixed bug. 
Game Won Showing in Error. | <img src="assets/images/CpuWin.PNG"> | - This bug was observed when the game was won by either the User or Computer. <br> - It caused the Score to increment in error. <br> - It was fixed by adding a new function for the scenario when the User loses the game. <br> - This function decrements the score by 1.
